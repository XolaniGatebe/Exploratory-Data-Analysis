# Titanic Survival Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my Titanic Survival EDA project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, uncovering key patterns and insights into passenger survival using Python-based data science techniques. Built as part of my journey to master data analysis, this project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and exploratory analysis—perfect for aspiring data analysts!

## Overview

This EDA dives into the Titanic dataset (available from Kaggle or similar sources) to explore factors influencing survival, including `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, and `Embarked`. Leveraging Python libraries and visualization tools, I’ve transformed raw data into actionable insights, addressing missing values and visualizing trends to tell a compelling data story.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values in `Age`, `Fare`, and `Embarked` using group-based imputation and statistical methods.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Investigated survival patterns across demographic and socioeconomic factors.
- **Visualizations**: Created countplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to highlight key trends.
- **Tools & Skills**: Utilized Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), with a foundation in SQL and potential for integration with databases like SQLite.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XolaniGatebe/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
   
3. **Download the dataset**:
   - Obtain the Titanic dataset (e.g., from Kaggle) and save it as titanic.csv in the project directory.
   - Alternatively, update the script to load from a different source.

4. **Run the Analysis**:
   ```bash
   Jupyter notebook Titanic.ipynb

## Usage

The main file, `Titanic.ipynb`, contains the EDA workflow. Key sections include:
- Loading and cleaning the dataset.

- Generating visualizations (e.g., survival by `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`, and `Fare` distributions).

- Computing summary statistics and correlations.

Open the notebook in Jupyter and explore the code—modify parameters (e.g., age bins, color palettes) to suit your analysis needs!

## Key Findings

- Survival Patterns: Females and 1st class passengers exhibited higher survival rates, with Cherbourg (C) passengers outperforming others due to class distribution.

- Data Insights: Age imputation by `Pclass` and `Sex` revealed nuanced survival trends.

- Visual Highlights: Heatmaps and countplots underscored the "women and children first" policy and class-based evacuation priorities.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming**: Python for data manipulation and analysis in Jupyter.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing data with statistical techniques.

- **Visualization**: Crafting informative plots with seaborn and matplotlib.

- **Analytical Thinking**: Identifying and interpreting data-driven insights.

- **Foundation**: Built on SQL expertise from projects like ShelfTrack, adaptable to database integration.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate SQL queries to enhance data retrieval and analysis.

- Add statistical tests (e.g., chi-square) to validate findings.

- Expand visualizations with interactive dashboards using Tableau or Power BI.
